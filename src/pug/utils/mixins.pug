      +e.desc
        p Each plan in our club has a certain number of allocated slots. Slots are effectively the number of funding spots that a user is allowed to fill. You can fund your account to start making profit with the club, but if you donâ€™t have a free slot you have to wait till one of your existing plan expires. This rule has been placed so we can effectively manage users portfolio using our strategy.
